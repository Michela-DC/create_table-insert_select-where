1) Using the "Ingredient" table from the What is a Database video, write and run your own CREATE TABLE SQL statement, ensure all columns are appropriate types

If you create a table incorrectly and want to delete it type DROP TABLE INGREDIENT.

Also make sure there are semi colons after your Create table statements, otherwise there may be errors!

Good luck!
