1) Using the "Ingredient" table from the What is a Database video, write and run your own CREATE TABLE SQL statement, ensure all columns are appropriate types

If you create a table incorrectly and want to delete it type DROP TABLE INGREDIENT.

Also make sure there are semi colons after your Create table statements, otherwise there may be errors!

Good luck!


2) Write insert statements to insert the following 5 ingredients:
   Eggs
   Bread
   Beef Patty
   Lettuce
   Yoghurt

   Write a SELECT statement to select the NAME of all the ingredients.
   Write a SELECT statement to select the NAME and the PRICE of the ingredients
   Write a SELECT statement to select all columns of ingredients, ordered by NAME
   Write a SELECT statement to select all columns of ingredients, ordered by "GLUTEN_FREE" with the "true" items on top
